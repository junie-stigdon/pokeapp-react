# PokeApp React

This program is for Pokemon players who have trouble remembering type effectiveness (and don't like looking at charts). This program runs on your local host.

This [React](https://reactjs.org/) project integrates with the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to provide the user with a type effectiveness guide. Using the API, you are able to look up any Pokemon's type, weakness, strength, and stats.  

This project was created with:

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)

This project is a recreation of my previous [PokeApp](https://github.com/junie-stigdon/pokeapp), but it uses React and the PokeAPI.
